        <p> <b> My Awesome Cart Pvt Ltd. </b> is an Indian electronic commerce company based in Bengaluru, India. Founded By Shubham Kumar in 2021, the company initially focused on book sales, before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, and lifestyle products.
          The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] as of March 2022, My Awesome Cart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[7] My awesome Cart is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its acquisitions of Myntra and Jabong.com), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[8] My Awesome Cart also owns PhonePe,
          a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).</p>

        <h2>Experiment Learn Grow</h2>
        <p>Our journey of building India's biggest unicorn
start-up has been full of successes, but also failures
and learning from them. That's why there's calculated
risk-taking, a high willingness to learn and improvise,
and a growth orientation built into everything we do.
Whether it be opening a new warehouse, or making
our mobile app a bit more consumer friendly, we're
always experimenting, learning and growing! </p>
